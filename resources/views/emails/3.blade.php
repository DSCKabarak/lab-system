                            Dear sir/madam,</p><p><br></p><p>The KEMRI Nairobi HIV lab is currently in the process of updating facility contact details in its database.</p><p>This has been necessitated by the high staff turnover that has been reported by most of the facilities we serve.</p><p>Due to this, we are recommending that all facilities create a facility e-mail address to be used in place of personal e-mail addresses for facility focal persons as has been the case.</p><p>Kindly send your facility's VL/CCC focal person's Phone number and the facility's e-mail address to eid-nairobi@googlegroups.com to enable us communicate with you better.</p><p>Thank you for your continued cooperation.</p><p><br></p><p>Regards,</p><p>Emmah Maina.<br></p>
